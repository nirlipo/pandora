This example shows how to implement a Markov Decision-Making Process using library libmdp develpoed at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.
The set of agents look for the best movements to maximise the quantity of collected resources. Every time step an agent:

- Evaluates the best movement based on MDP. It can stay at the cell where it is, or move to any of the 8 adjacent neighbors.
- Execute the movement and collects 3 resources (if did not move) or 1 resource (if it moved)
- Consumes 2 resources
